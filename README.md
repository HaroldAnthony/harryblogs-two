# harryblogs-two
The evolution of the original HTML-CSS harryblogs site.

16-06-2024 14:11 - The first update to this README file. I've created this repository, hoping to get started with my first MERN stack project, to add it to my resume, and my experience.

22-06-2024 13:10 - I encountered problems with Emmet abbreviations (specifically, the lorem upsum text generation), which I rectified, referring to solutions available, over at Stack Overflow.

24-06-2024 12:42 - I found solutions to all the problems I encountered since the inception of project, until now. The problems, and their solutions, are listed below numerically -
                   <p> 1) Word wrapping - the solution was simply the keyboard shortcut - Alt + Z, or using Toggle Word Wrap in the VS Code search options.
                   <p> 2) lorem ipsum - turns out I didn't need any extension installation. I had to just use emmet.includeLanguages and specify "javascript" : "javascriptreact" (I realized that lorem ipsum 
                   actually worked fine in a html file)
                   <p> 3) small color preview box - I also realized that the color I used, in a h1 tag, was a Tailwind color, and I just had to install the Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension (Before this, I 
                   found out that color boxes did appear beside color values in a css file)

04-07-2024 15:11 - Moving onto the back-end part of the project, upon the completion of the basic vanilla front-end styling and functionalities.

09-07-2024 13:25 - After installation of Express, nodemon, and creation of the server.js (which replaced index.js as the 'main' file [as specified in the package.json file]), as well as port definition (PORT, 8000), Postman is installed, to test the running of the actual server.
